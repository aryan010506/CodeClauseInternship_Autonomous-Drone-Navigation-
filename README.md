# 🛰️ Autonomous Drone Navigation AI

> A Python-based AI system that enables a drone to autonomously navigate a grid environment, avoid obstacles, and reach a predefined destination using Q-learning.

---

## 🎯 Aim

Build an AI system that allows a drone to navigate autonomously, avoiding obstacles and reaching predefined destinations.

---

## 📄 Description

This project simulates an autonomous drone navigating through a 2D grid using reinforcement learning. It learns to:
- Avoid randomly placed obstacles
- Make optimal movement decisions
- Reach a fixed goal destination

The environment is displayed using OpenCV and trained using the Q-learning algorithm. The drone learns over thousands of episodes how to reach its destination efficiently.
